  <h1>Welcome one and all to the zoo that is the mind of <strong>Steve</strong></h1>

<body>
  <p>Welcome, hi, hello. Glad you could make it to the crazyest place on earth. My mind is often filled with monkeys
    juggling riding unicycles, but today no. Today your in for a treat because instead of juggling monkeys, you get to
    learn just what makes me tic.... sort of.<br />As you already know my name is Steven, but you can call me
    <i>SteveO.</i>I was born in 1978 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. I moved to eastern Washington when I was 7 and lived on
    top of a mountain, 100 miles from the nearest town. I moved to Everett in 1986 then finally moved to Marysville in
    1987. I graduated high school in 1997 where then I started college but after 6 months of straight work and school I
    got sick and had to drop out.<br />Once I felt better I immediately went to work as a door-to-door vaccume salesmen.
    I sold 12 vaccumes and never saw a penny, had to use my own car and gas to get to the customers houses too. One day
    while out in the middle of nowhere in a run down trailer attempting to sell a 1500 vaccume to poor people my
    bestfriend called and told me that Waste Management had an opening for another garbage collector. So I quit on the
    spot, and no I didnt make a sale that day but I did however get a shiny new vaccume cleaner though ! ;)<br />A
    couple weeks later I was driving as a garbage man or <i>Sanitary specialist</i>as like to call it. Almost exactly at
    my 2 year mark of driving with Waste Management one day, while out on my route, my clipboard had slid over to the
    work side of the truck where I was standing. It locked my steeering wheel in place and before I could throw it outta
    the way it was too late, I was being pulled into the ditch on the side of the road and rolled the truck on it's
    side. Because It was an accident the company sent me in for a drug test where I failed because I had the previous
    weekend before had dabbled in a little bit of marijuana at a party. It was then that I found myself without a job
    and needing to figure something out <strong>QUICK</strong>!<br />After day 2 it happened, Sept. 11<sup>th</sup>2001<br />A day
    im sure you remember well. I knew what it was that I needed to do, and That was join the military.<br />I went to the
    only open office which was the Navy and signed up. I didn't even tell my wife, I just did it. She mind you was
    <strong>PISSED</strong>, but she quickly got over it. While in the military I got to travel to 5 states and 15
    different Countrys. In the service my job or rate as it's called was an Aviation Ordnanceman or AO for short. As an
    AO I build bombs and missles that got loaded on to the FA-18 super hornet, and as a member of the weapons department
    I also stood all security gun watches and trained new sailors and old sailors how to shoot and helped with keeping
    their quals up to par. I was also a member of the fast attack small inflatable rib boat crew where I manned the m60
    machine gun, my job was to provide cover fire and protection for the Navy Seals to do their missions. I did see
    action but that's another story for another time. once
    I was honorably discharged after 8 years of service to this fine, outstanding Country I moved back from sunny San
    Diego back here to Marysville.<br />Where I became an aircraft electrician and team lead at the Boeing Company where I
    worked at until I was once again fired.<br />OH, what's that ? Why was I fired you ask ? Well, my friends that too is
    another story for another time.<br/> My goals are to finally find a career that I can retire at, and at the same time
    make some damn good money while im at it.</p>
